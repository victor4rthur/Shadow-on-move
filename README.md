Mouse Hover Text Shadow Effect
This JavaScript code enhances user experience by creating a dynamic text shadow effect on an HTML <h1> element. The effect is triggered by the movement of the mouse over a designated area, represented by the .hero element.

Usage
Include the provided JavaScript code in your project.
Ensure that you have an HTML structure with an element with the class .hero and an <h1> element for the text.
Customize the walk variable to control the distance of the text shadow movement.

Watch the magic happen! As the mouse moves over the .hero element, the text shadow dynamically adjusts based on the mouse position, creating a visually appealing effect.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your project's styling and requirements.
